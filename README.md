A box with rotary selection switch for project, two mushroom-buttons and a OLED-display. An ESP8266 is used as a WiFi interface. The projects are downloaded through the web page's API at bootup, start and stop actions are synchronized online. To setup the box it has a simple web-page built in which can be accessed through the accesspoint which is started if WiFi connection fails or by pressing both buttons just after powerup.
